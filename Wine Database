-- This project involves the creation of a database of top wines from 2023. 
-- Tools / Skills: Excel, SQL, ChatGPT 3.5

/**
Step 1. Find a source listing at least 50 wines from different parts of the world. Ideally source includes many variables for columns, such as tasting notes.

Step 2. Convert the wine list into an Excel spreadsheet



  - copy and paste into Word to clean up data do mass replacements of unneeded symbols, 
  - use ChatGPT to break up descriptions into columns (e.g., 
    PROMPT: Create a spreadsheet from the following data.  include the wine number (#), name, description, varietal (if applicable), type (red, white, rosé, sparkling, dessert), if applicable,  recommended drink-through period, cases made, cases imported (if applicable), and reviewer initials.
INPUT: "Occidental Pinot Noir West Sonoma Coast Freestone-Occidental - Boasts blackberry and plum fruit enlivened by a light savory thread, while anise and iris notes add range through the sleek, tangy finish. Shows a nice underlying mineral edge, which adds subtle tension throughout. Refined. Drink now through 2030. 4,000 cases made. —JM"
  OUTPUT: 




  - add commas to break up multi-column information (e.g., "Résonance Pinot Noir Willamette Valley" to "Résonance, Pinot Noir, Willamette Valley" (name, varietal, location)
  - research unknown regions to add country name
  - research unknown wines to assign type (red, white, rosé, sparkling)
Step 3.
