-- This project involves the creation of a database of top Californian wines. 
-- Tools / Skills: SQL, SQLite Studio, Excel, ChatGPT 3.5

/**
Step 1. Find a data source for wine 
  => Wine Spectator magazine (aka WS): winespectator.com
Step 2. Select data
  => Using the search function on WS, I selected wines: 
      a) from California 
      b) honored in a Top-100 list from the past 11 years (2013-2023). 
  => result: 229 entries
Step 3. Clean data
  - 4 entries did not include Top 100 rankings => result = 225 entries 
  - edit data in Word to enable import and text-to-column in excel
  - separate data into columns for comma separated values
  - use ChatGPT to break up the wine description into columns (not comma separated values)
PROMPT: Create a table from the following data.  include the wine number id, name, description, varietal, type (red, white, rosé, sparkling, dessert), if applicable,  recommended drink-through period, cases made, cases imported (if applicable), and reviewer initials. make a row for each of the 50 entries.
Create a table from the following data.  Include the id number, name, description, varietal, type (red, white, rosé, sparkling, dessert), reviewer initials, recommended drink-through period, and cases made. Make a row for each of the entries. some of the columns will not have data for that row. 
Example INPUT: 1	DAOU Cabernet Sauvignon Adelaida District Estate 2014	Combines rich, deep flavors with a measure of finesse and refinement, allowing the earth-laced red berry and spicy herb notes to shine. Ripe, sturdy tannins lend this structure and traction. Best from 2020 through 2034. 1,000 cases made. –JL
OUTPUT: 
| ID | Name | Description | Varietal | Type | Reviewer Initials | Recommended Drink-Through Period | Cases Made |
|----|------|-------------|----------|------|-------------------|----------------------------------|------------|

Step 4. Create csv spreadsheets and import them into SQLite Studio
table_name: column1, column2, etc.
wines: id,	name,	vintage,	winery,	region,	color,	sparkling,	type,	blend_varietals,	primary_grape,	cases_made,	release_price
ratings: wine_id, review,	score,	top_100_year,	rank,	reviewer_id,	ws_designation,	review_date,	release_price,	recommended_drink	
reviewers: reviewer_id,	initials,	name,	position,	location,	tasting_beat,	notes
